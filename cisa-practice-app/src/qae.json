    "Question": "The internal audit department wrote some scripts that are used for continuous auditing. The IT department asked for copies of the scripts so that they can be used for setting up a continuous monitoring process on key systems. Considering the ability of the information systems (IS) auditors to independently and objectively audit the IT function, should sharing these scripts be permitted?",
    "OptionA": "Sharing the scripts is not permitted because it gives IT the ability to pre-audit systems and avoid an accurate, comprehensive audit.",
    "OptionB": "Sharing the scripts is required because IT must have the ability to review all programs and software that run on information systems regardless of audit independence.",
    "OptionC": "Sharing the scripts is permissible if IT recognizes that audits may be conducted in areas not covered in the scripts.",
    "OptionD": "Sharing the scripts is not permitted because the IS auditors who wrote the scripts would not be permitted to audit any information systems where the scripts are being used for monitoring.",
    "CorrectAnswer": "C",
    "Domain": "INFORMATION SYSTEM AUDITING PROCESS",
    "Explanation": "A. The ability of IT to continuously monitor and address any issues on IT systems does not affect the ability of information systems (IS) audit to perform a comprehensive audit. B. Sharing the scripts may be required by policy for quality assurance and configuration management, but that does not impair the ability to audit. C. IS audit may not be able to review the effectiveness of the scripts, but it can still audit all aspects of the systems.",

    "Explanation": "A. The complexity ofthe organization's operation is a factor in the planning of an audit but does not directly affect the determination of how much data to collect. The extent of data collection is subject to the intensity, scope and purpose of the audit. B. Prior findings and issues are factors in the planning of an audit but do not directly affect the determination of how much data to collect. Data must be collected outside of areas of previous findings. C. The extent to which data will be collected during an information systems (IS) audit is related directly to the purpose, objective and scope of the audit An audit with a narrow purpose and limited objective and scope is most likely to result in less data collection than an audit with a wider purpose and scope. Statistical analysis may also determine the extent of data collection, such as sample size or means of data collection. D. An auditor's familiarity with the organization is a factor in the planning of an audit but does not directly affect the determination of how much data to collect.

    "Explanation": "A. Auditing the new systems does not reflect a risk-based approach. Although the systems can contain sensitive data and may present risk of data loss or disclosure to the organization, without a risk assessment, the decision to solely audit the newly implemented systems is not a risk-based decision. B. Auditing systems not included in the previous year's scope does not reflect a risk-based approach. In addition, management may know about problems with the new systems and may intentionally try to steer the audit away from that vulnerable area. Although, at first, the new system may seem to be the riskiest area, an assessment must be conducted rather than relying on the judgment of the information systems (IS) auditor or IT manager. C.

    "Explanation": "A. Overlapping controls are two controls addressing the same control objective or exposure. Because primary controls cannot be achieved when duties cannot or are not appropriately segregated, it is difficult to install overlapping controls. B. Boundary controls establish the interface between the would-be user of a computer system and the computer system itself and are individual-based, not role-based, controls. C. Access controls for resources are based on individuals and not on roles. For a lack of separation of duties, the information systems (IS) auditor expects to find that a person has higher levels of access than are ideal.

    "Explanation": "A. Because the interaction between parties is electronic, there is no inherent authentication occurring; therefore, lack of transaction authorization is the greatest risk. B. Loss or duplication of electronic data interchange transmissions is an example of risk, but because all transactions should be logged, the impact is not as great as that ofunauthorized transactions. C. Transmission delays may terminate the process or hold the line until the normal time for processing has elapsed; however, there will be no loss of data. D. Deletion or manipulation of transactions prior to, or after, establishment of application controls is an example of risk. Logging detects any alteration to the data, and the impact is not as great as that of unauthorized transactions.",

    "OptionD": "audit costs will be kept at a minimum level.",
    "CorrectAnswer": "A",
    "Domain": "INFORMATION SYSTEM AUDITING PROCESS",
    "Explanation": "A. B. C. D. Procedures are processes that an information systems (IS) auditor may follow in an audit engagement. In determining the appropriateness of any specific procedure, an IS auditor should use professional judgment that is appropriate to the specific circumstances. Professional judgment involves a subjective and often qualitative evaluation of conditions arising during an audit. Judgment addresses a grey area where binary (yes/no) decisions are not appropriate, and the IS auditor's past experience plays a key role in making a judgment. The IS auditor should use judgment in assessing the sufficiency of evidence to be collected. ISACA guidelines provide information on how to meet the standards when performing IS audit work. The correction of deficiencies is the responsibility of management and is not a part of the audit procedure selection process. Identifying material weaknesses is the result of appropriate competence, experience and thoroughness in planning and executing the audit, and not of professional judgment. Professional judgment is not a primary input to the financial aspects ofthe audit. Audit procedures and use of professional judgment cannot ensure that all deficiencies/weaknesses will be identified and conected. Professional judgment ensures that audit resources and costs are used wisely, but this is not the primary objective of the auditor when selecting audit procedures.",

    "Explanation": "A. It is important that the information systems (IS) auditor does not immediately assume that everything on the network diagram provides information about the risk affecting a network/system. There is a process in place for documenting and updating the network diagram. B. In a risk-based approach to an IS audit, the scope is determined by the impact that the devices will have on the audit. If the undocumented devices do not impact the audit scope, then they may be excluded from the current audit engagement. The information provided on a network diagram can vary depending on what is being illustrated—for example, the network layer and cross connections. C. In this case, there is simply a mismatch in timing between the completion of the approval process and when the IS audit began. There is no control deficiency to be reported.",

    "Explanation": "A. Control self-assessments (CSAs) require employees to assess the control stature of their own function. CSAs help to increase the understanding of business risk and internal controls. Because they are conducted more frequently than audits, CSAs help to identify risk in a timelier manner. B. CSAs do not replace the internal audit function; an audit must still be performed to ensure that controls are present. C. CSAs may not reduce the audit function's workload and are not a major difference between the two approaches.",

    "Explanation": "A. Although the information security policy should be updated on a regular basis, the specific time period may vary based on the organization. Although reviewing policies annually is a good practice, the policy may be updated less frequently and still be relevant and effective. An outdated policy is still enforceable, whereas a policy without proper approval is not enforceable. B. The lack of a revision history with respect to the information security (IS) policy document is an issue but not as significant as not having it approved by management. A new policy, for example, may not have been subject to any revisions yet. C. The information security policy should have an owner who has management responsibility for the development, review, approval and evaluation of the security policy. The position of security administrator is typically a staff-level position (not management), and therefore does not have the authority to approve the policy. In addition, an individual in a more independent position should also review the policy. Without proper management approval, enforcing the policy may be problematic, leading to compliance or security issues. D. Although a policy committee drawn from across the organization is a good practice and may help write better policies, a good policy can be written by a single person, and the lack of a committee is not a problem by itself.",

The most critical issue in this scenario is that the enterprise architecture (EA) is undergoing change, so the IS auditor should be most concerned with reporting this issue. B. It is critical for the EA to include the future state because the gap between the current state and the future state will determine IT strategic and tactical plans. If the EA does not include a future-state representation, it is not complete, and this issue should be reported as a finding. C.

    "CorrectAnswer": "C",
    "Domain": "GOVERNANCE AND MANAGEMENT OF IT",
    "Explanation": "A. Although security controls should be a requirement for any application, the primary fbcus of the enterprise architecture (EA) is to ensure that new applications are consistent with enterprise standards. Although the use of standard supported technology may be more secure, this is not the primary benefit of the E A. B. When selecting an application, the business requirements and the suitability of the application for the IT environment must be considered. If the business unit selects its application without IT involvement, it is more likely to choose a solution that fits its business process the best with less emphasis on how compatible and supportable the solution will be in the enterprise, and this is not a concern. C. The primary focus of the EA is to ensure that technology investments are consistent with the platform, data and development standards of the IT organization. The EA defines both a current and future state in areas such as the use of standard platforms, databases or programming languages. If a business unit selected an application using a database or operating system that is not part of the EA for the business, this increases the cost and complexity of the solution and ultimately delivers less value to the business. D. Although any new software implementation may create support issues, the primary benefit of the EA is ensuring that the IT solutions deliver value to the business. Decreased support costs may be a benefit of the EA, but the lack ofIT involvement in this case does not affect the support requirements.",

What is the MOST appropriate recommendation in this situation?",
    "OptionA": "Create an IT risk management department and establish an IT risk framework with the aid of external risk management experts.",
    "OptionB": "Use common industry standard aids to divide the existing risk documentation into several individual types of risk, which will be easier to handle.",
    "OptionC": "No recommendation is necessary because the current approach is appropriate for a medium-sized organization.",
    "OptionD": "Establish regular IT risk management meetings to identify and assess risk and create a mitigation plan as input to the organization's risk management.",
    "CorrectAnswer": "D",
    "Domain": "GOVERNANCE AND MANAGEMENT OF IT",
    "Explanation": "A. A medium-sized organization does not normally have a separate IT risk management department due to limited resources. Moreover, the IT risk can usually be managed without the assistance of external experts. B. Although common risk may be covered by industry standards, they cannot address the specific situation of an organization. Individual types of risk will not be discovered without a detailed assessment from within the organization. Splitting the one risk position into several is not sufficient to manage IT risk. C. The auditor should recommend a formal IT risk management effort because a few broadly described types of IT risk contained in the operational risk documentation are insufficient. The failure to demonstrate responsible IT risk management may be a liability for the organization. D. Establishing regular IT risk management meetings is the best way to identify and assess IT-related risk in a medium-sized organization, to address responsibilities with the respective management and to keep the risk register and mitigation plans up to date.",

Thus, the overall business risk can be expressed as the likelihood of the occurrence and magnitude of the impact when a threat exploits a vulnerability and provides the best measure of the risk to an asset. B. A threat source is the intent and method targeted at the intentional exploitation of a vulnerability or a situation and method that may accidentally trigger a vulnerability. A threat is an event or situation that has the potential for causing undesirable consequences or impact. The calculation of risk must consider impact and likelihood of a threat (not a threat source) exploiting a vulnerability. C.

Hardware in the test environment should mirror the production environment to ensure that testing is reliable. However, this does not relate to the risk of using live data in a test environment and is not the correct answer. D. In many cases, the test environment is not configured with the same access controls that are enabled in the production environment For example, programmers may have privileged access to the test environment (for testing purposes), but not to the production environment. If the test environment does not have adequate access control, the production data are subject to risk of unauthorized access and/or data disclosure. This is the most significant risk of the choices listed and is especially important in a health care organization where patient data confidentiality is critical and privacy laws in many countries impose strict penalties on misuse of these data.

    "Question": "The information systems (IS) auditor is reviewing a recently completed conversion to a new enterprise resource planning system. In the final stage of the conversion process, the organization ran the old and new systems in parallel for 30 days before allowing the new system to run on its own. What is the MOST significant advantage to the organization by using this strategy?",
    "OptionA": "Significant cost savings over other testing approaches",
    "OptionB": "Assurance that new, faster hardware is compatible with the new system",
    "OptionC": "Assurance that the new system meets functional requirements",
    "OptionD": "Increased resiliency during the parallel processing time",
    "CorrectAnswer": "C",
    "Domain": "INFORMATION SYSTEMS ACQUISITION, DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION",
    "Explanation": "A. Parallel operation is generally expensive and does not provide a cost savings over most other testing approaches. In many cases, parallel operation is the most expensive form of system testing due to the need for dual data entry, dual sets of hardware, dual maintenance and dual backups. Parallel operation is twice the amount ofwork as running a production system and, therefore, costs more time and money. B. Hardware compatibility should be determined and tested much earlier in the conversion project and is not an advantage of parallel operation. Compatibility is generally determined based on the application's published specifications and on system testing in a lab environment. Parallel operation is designed to test the application's effectiveness and integrity of application data, not hardware compatibility. In general, hardware compatibility relates more to the operating system level than to a particular application. Although new hardware in a system conversion must be tested under a real production load, this can be done without parallel systems. C. Parallel operation provides a high level of assurance that the new system ftinctions properly compared to the old system, and therefore, the new system meets its functional requirements. This is the safest form of system conversion testing because, if the new system fails, the old system is still available for production use. In addition, this form of testing allows the application developers and administrators to simultaneously run operational tasks (e.g., batch jobs and backups) on both systems, to ensure that the new system is reliable before unplugging the old system.",

    "OptionD": "Beta testing",
    "CorrectAnswer": "D",
    "Domain": "INFORMATION SYSTEMS ACQUISITION, DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION",
    "Explanation": "A. Alpha testing is the testing stage just before beta testing. Alpha testing is typically performed by programmers and business analysts, instead of users. Alpha testing is used to identify bugs or glitches that can be fixed before beta testing begins with external users. B. White box testing is performed much earlier in the software development life cycle than alpha or beta testing. White box testing is used to assess the effectiveness of software program logic, where test data are used to determine procedural accuracy of the programs being tested. This testing stage determines if the program operates the way it is supposed to at a functional level. White box testing does not typically involve external users. C. Regression testing is the process ofre-running a portion of a test scenario to ensure that changes or corrections have not introduced more errors (i.e., the same tests are run after multiple successive program changes to ensure that the fix for one problem did not break another part of the program). Regression testing is not the last stage of testing and does not typically involve external users. D. Beta testing is the final stage of testing and typically includes users outside of the development area. Beta testing is a form of user acceptance testing and generally involves a limited number of users who are external to the development effort",

It is not related to reviewing the source of a transaction. B. An ITF creates a fictitious entity in the database to process test transactions simultaneously with live input. Its advantage is that periodic testing does not require separate test processes. Carefill planning is necessary, and test data must be isolated from production data. C. An ITF does validate the correct operation of a transaction in an application, but it does not ensure that a system is being operated correctly. D.

    "CorrectAnswer": "A",
    "Domain": "INFORMATION SYSTEMS ACQUISITION, DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION",
    "Explanation": "A. This approach maximizes the usefulness of testing by concentrating on the most important aspects of the system and on the areas where defects represent the greatest risk to user acceptance. A further extension of this approach is to also consider the technical complexity of requirements because complexity tends to increase the likelihood of defects. B. The problem with testing only functional requirements is that nonfunctional requirement areas, such as usability and security, which are important to the overall quality ofthe system, are ignored. C. Increasing the efficiency of testing by automating test execution is a good idea. However, by itself this approach does not ensure the appropriate targeting oftest coverage and is not an effective alternative. D. Retesting only defect fixes has a considerable risk that it will not detect instances in which defect fixes may have caused the system to regress (i.e., introduced errors in parts of the system that were previously working correctly). For this reason, it is a good practice to undertake formal regression testing after defect fixes have been implemented.",

Although quality management is important to properly establish a software development project, quality management should be effectively practiced throughout the project. The major source of unexpected costs on most software projects is rework. The general rule is that the earlier in the development life cycle that a defect occurs, and the longer it takes to find and fix that defect, the more effort will be needed to correct it. A well-written quality management plan is a good start, but it must also be actively applied. Simply relying on testing to identify defects is a relatively costly and less effective way of achieving software quality.

    "CorrectAnswer": "A",
    "Domain": "INFORMATION SYSTEMS ACQUISITION, DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION",
    "Explanation": "A. Cost performance of a project cannot be properly assessed in isolation of schedule performance. Cost cannot be assessed simply in terms of elapsed time on a project B. To properly assess the project budget position, it is necessary to know how much progress has actually been made and, given this, what level of expenditure would be expected. It is possible that project expenditure appears to be low because actual progress has been slow. Until the analysis of project against schedule has been completed, it is impossible to know whether there is any reason to reduce budget. If the project has slipped behind schedule, then it is possible that not only there is no spare budget, but also extra expenditure may be needed to retrieve the slippage. The low expenditure can be representative of a situation where the project is likely to miss deadlines rather than potentially come in ahead of time. C. If the project is found to be ahead of budget after adjusting for actual progress, this is not necessarily a good outcome, because it points to flaws in the original budgeting process; and, until further analysis is undertaken, it cannot be determined whether any spare funds actually exist. D. If the project is behind schedule, adding scope may be the wrong thing to do.",

    "OptionC": "Predefined service level report templates",
    "OptionD": "A clause regarding supplier limitation of liability",
    "CorrectAnswer": "A",
    "Domain": "INFORMATION SYSTEMS OPERATIONS AND BUSINESS RESILIENCE",
    "Explanation": "A. The absence of a right to audit clause or other forms of attestation that the supplier is compliant with a certain standard would potentially prevent the information systems (IS) auditor from investigating any aspect of supplier performance moving forward, including control deficiencies, poor performance, and adherence to legal requirements. The absence of this clause would be a major concern for the IS auditor because it would be difficult for the organization to assess whether the appropriate controls were implemented. B. Although a clear definition of penalty payment terms is desirable, not all contracts require the payment of penalties for poor performance. When performance penalties are required, these penalties are often subject to negotiation on a case-by-case basis. Therefore, the absence of this information is not as significant as a lack of right to audit. C. Although the inclusion of service level report templates is desirable, if the requirement for service level reporting is included in the contract, the absence of predefined templates for reporting is not a significant concern. D. The absence of a limitation of liability clause for the service provider exposes the provider to unlimited liability. This is to the advantage of the outsourcing organization so, although the IS auditor might highlight the absence of such a clause, it does not constitute a major concern.",

    "CorrectAnswer": "B",
    "Domain": "INFORMATION SYSTEMS OPERATIONS AND BUSINESS RESILIENCE",
    "Explanation": "A. The customer organization would want to retain data ownership and, therefore, this would not be a risk. B. Organizations must review the regulatory environment in which the cloud provider operates because it may have requirements or restrictions of its own. Some service providers reserve the right to access customer information (third-party access) to perform certain transactions and provide certain services. In the case of protected health information, regulations may restrict certain access. Organizations must then determine whether the cloud provider provides appropriate controls to ensure data security. C. An organization may eventually wish to discontinue its service with a third-party cloud-based provider. The organization would then want to remove its data from the system and ensure that the service provider clears the system (including any backups) of its data. Some providers do not offer automated or bulk data withdrawal mechanisms, which the organization needs to migrate its data. These aspects should be clarified prior to using a third-party provider. D. An organization may need to plan its own data recovery processes and procedures if the service provider does not make this available or the organization has doubts about the service provider's processes.

    "Question": "A vendor released several critical security patches over the past few months, which put a strain on the ability of the administrators to keep the patches tested and deployed in a timely manner. The administrators asked if they could reduce the testing of the patches. What approach should the organization take?",
    "OptionA": "Continue the current process of testing and applying patches.",
    "OptionB": "Reduce testing and ensure that an adequate back-out plan is in place.",
    "OptionC": "Delay patching until resources for testing are available.",
    "OptionD": "Rely on the vendor's testing ofthe patches.",
    "CorrectAnswer": "A",
    "Domain": "INFORMATION SYSTEMS OPERATIONS AND BUSINESS RESILIENCE",
    "Explanation": "A. Applying security software patches promptly is critical to maintaining the security of the servers; further, testing the patches is important because the patches may aflect other systems and business operations. Because the vendor recently released several critical patches in a short time, the organization may choose to wait to see if this is a temporary problem before making a revision to policy or procedures. B. Reduced testing increases the risk of business operation disruption due to a faulty or incompatible patch. Although a back-out plan does help mitigate this risk, a thorough testing up front is the more appropriate option. C. Applying security software patches promptly is critical to maintaining the security of the servers. Delaying patching increases the risk of a security breach due to system vulnerability.",

    "OptionA": "The client did not pay for the open-source software components.",
    "OptionB": "The organization and client must comply with open-source software license terms.",
    "OptionC": "Open-source software has security vulnerabilities.",
    "OptionD": "Open-source software is unreliable for commercial use.",
    "CorrectAnswer": "B",
    "Domain": "INFORMATION SYSTEMS OPERATIONS AND BUSINESS RESILIENCE",
    "Explanation": "A. A major benefit of using open-source software is that it is free. The client is not required to pay for the open-source software components; however, both the developing organization and the client should be concerned about the licensing terms and conditions of the open source software components that are being used. B. There are many types of open-source software licenses and each has different terms and conditions. Some open-source software licensing allows use of the open-source software component freely but requires that the completed software product must also allow the same rights. This is known as viral licensing, and if the development organization is not careful, its products can violate licensing terms by selling the product for profit. The information systems (IS) auditor should be most concerned with open-source software licensing compliance to avoid unintended intellectual property risk or legal consequences. C. Open-source software, just like any software code, should be tested for security flaws and should be part of the normal system development life cycle (SDLC) process. This is not more of a concern than licensing compliance. D. Open-source software does not inherently lack quality. Like any software code, it should be tested for reliability and should be part of the normal SDLC process. This is not more of a concern than licensing compliance. 267 C/SA ®Official Questions, Answers & Explanations Manual13th Edition",

    "Question": "An information systems (IS) auditor reviewing database controls discovered that changes to the database during normal working hours were handled through a standard set of procedures. However, changes made after normal hours required only an abbreviated number of steps. In this situation, which ofthe following is considered an adequate set of compensating controls?",
    "OptionA": "Allow changes to be made only with the database administrator (DBA) user account.",
    "OptionB": "Make changes to the database after granting access to a normal user account.",
    "OptionC": "Use the DBA user account to make changes, log the changes and review the change log the following day.",

    "CorrectAnswer": "C",
    "Domain": "INFORMATION SYSTEMS OPERATIONS AND BUSINESS RESILIENCE",
    "Explanation": "A. The use of the database administrator (DBA) user account without logging permits uncontrolled changes to be made to databases after access to the account was obtained. B. A normal user account should not have access to a database. This permits uncontrolled changes to any of the databases. C. The use of a DBA user account is normally set up to log all changes made and is most appropriate for changes made outside of normal hours. The use of a log, which records the changes, allows changes to be reviewed. Because an abbreviated number of steps are used, this represents an adequate set of compensating controls. D. Users should not be able to make changes. Logging only provides information on changes made but does not limit changes to only those who were authorized.",

    "Explanation": "A. Risk transfer is the transference of risk to a third party (e.g., buying insurance for activities that pose a risk). B. A reciprocal agreement in which two organizations agree to provide computing resources to each other in the event of a disaster is a form of risk mitigation. This usually works well if both organizations have similar information processing facilities. Because the intended effect of reciprocal agreements is to have a functional disaster recovery plan (DRP), it is a risk mitigation strategy. C. Risk avoidance is the decision to cease operations or activities that give rise to a risk. For example, an organization may stop accepting credit card payments to avoid the risk of credit card information disclosure. D. Risk acceptance occurs when an organization decides to accept the risk as it is and to do nothing to mitigate or transfer it.",

    "CorrectAnswer": "B",
    "Domain": "INFORMATION SYSTEMS OPERATIONS AND BUSINESS RESILIENCE",
    "Explanation": "A. Alternative routing is a method of routing information via an alternate medium, such as copper cable or fiber optics. This involves the use of different networks, circuits or end points ifthe normal network is unavailable. B. Diverse routing routes traffic through split-cable facilities or duplicate-cable facilities. This can be accomplished with different and/or duplicate cable sheaths. If different cable sheaths are used, the cable may be in the same conduit and, therefore, subject to the same interruptions as the cable it is backing up. The communication service subscriber can duplicate the facilities by having alternate routes, although the entrance to and from the customer premises may be in the same conduit. The subscriber can obtain diverse routing and alternate routing from the local carrier, including dual-entrance facilities. This type of access is time-consuming and costly. C.

    "OptionD": "Emergency changes are authorized prior to promotion.",
    "CorrectAnswer": "A",
    "Domain": "INFORMATION SYSTEMS OPERATIONS AND BUSINESS RESILIENCE",
    "Explanation": "A. Production access should be controlled and monitored to ensure separation of duties. During an emergency change, a user who normally does not have access to production may require access. The best process to ensure accountability within the production system is to have the information security team create a production support group and add the user ID to that group to promote the change. When the change is complete the ID can be removed from the group. This process ensures that activity in production is linked to the specific ID that was used to make the change. B. Some organizations may use a firefighter ID, which is a generic/shared ID, to promote changes to production. When needed, the developer can use this ID to access production. It may still be difficult to determine who made the change; therefore, although this process is commonly used, the use of a production support ID is a better choice. C. Having a dedicated user who promotes changes to production in an emergency is ideal but is generally not cost-effective and may not be realistic for emergency changes. D. Emergency changes are, by definition, unauthorized changes. Approvals usually are obtained following promotion of the change to production. All changes should be auditable, and that can best be accomplished by having a user ID added/removed to the production support group as needed.",

    "Question": "A medium-sized organization, whose IT disaster recovery measures have been in place and regularly tested for years, has just developed a formal business continuity plan (BCP). A basic BCP tabletop exercise has been performed successfully. Which testing should an information systems (IS) auditor recommend be performed next to verify the adequacy of the new BCP?",
    "OptionA": "Full-scale test with relocation of all departments, including IT, to the contingency site.",
    "OptionB": "Walk-through test of a series of predefined scenarios with all critical personnel involved.",
    "OptionC": "IT disaster recovery test with business departments involved in testing the critical applications.",
    "OptionD": "Functional test of a scenario with limited IT involvement.",
    "CorrectAnswer": "D",
    "Domain": "INFORMATION SYSTEMS OPERATIONS AND BUSINESS RESILIENCE",
    "Explanation": "A. A full-scale test in the situation described might fail because it would be the first time that the plan is actually exercised, and a number of resources (including IT) and time would be wasted. B. The walk-through test is a basic type of testing. Its intention is to make key staff familiar with the plan and discuss critical plan elements, rather than verifying its adequacy. C. The recovery of applications should always be verified and approved by the business instead ofbeing purely IT-driven. The IT plan has been tested repeatedly so a disaster recovery test would not help in verifying the administrative and organizational parts of the business continuity plan (BCP), which are not IT-related. D. After a tabletop exercise has been performed, the next step is a functional test, which includes the mobilization of staff to exercise the administrative and organizational functions of a recovery. Because the IT part of the recovery has been tested for years, it is more efficient to verify and optimize the BCP before actually involving IT in a full-scale test. The full-scale test would be the last step of the verification process before entering into a regular annual testing schedule. 349 C/SA ® Official Questions, Answers & Explanations Manual 13th Edition",

B. Functional testing involves mobilization of personnel and resources at various geographic sites. This is a more in-depth functional test and not primarily focused on coordination and communication. C. A full-scale test is a comprehensive and realistic simulation of a disaster scenario, involving multiple teams and resources. It aims to test the entire business continuity plan (BCP) in a real-world environment. Although coordination among various teams is essential in a full-scale test, it does not specifically mention the participation ofthe crisis management/response team or emphasize practicing proper coordination.

    "OptionD": "Log user access to the data warehouse.",
    "CorrectAnswer": "A",
    "Domain": "INFORMATION SYSTEMS OPERATIONS AND BUSINESS RESILIENCE",
    "Explanation": "A. Column- and row-level permissions control what information users can access. Column-level security prevents users from seeing one or more attributes on a table. With row-level security, a certain grouping of information on a table is restricted (e.g., if a table held details of employee salaries, then a restriction can be put in place to ensure that, unless specifically authorized, users cannot view the salaries of executive staff). Column- and row-level security can be achieved in a relational database by allowing users to access logical representations of data (views) rather than physical tables. This fine-grained security model is likely to offer the best balance between information protection while still supporting a wide range of analytical and reporting uses. B. Enhancing user authentication via strong passwords is a security control that should apply to all users of the data warehouse and does not specifically address protection of specific sensitive data. C. Organizing a data warehouse into subject-specific databases is a potentially useful practice but, alone, does not adequately protect sensitive data. Database-level security is normally too coarse of a level to efficiently and effectively protect information. For example, one database may hold information that needs to be restricted, such as employee salary and customer profitability details, while other information, such as employee department, may need to be legitimately accessed by a large number of users. Organizing the data warehouse into subject-matter-specific databases is similar to user access in that this control should generally apply. Extra attention can be devoted to reviewing access to tables with sensitive data, but this control is not sufficient without strong preventive controls at the column and row level.",

This practice is not safe because an attacker can intercept, modify and submit requests, which can discover information or perform functions that the web developer never intended. The malicious modification of web application parameters is known as parameter tampering. B. Cross-site scripting involves the compromise of the web page to redirect users to content on the attacker website. The use of hidden fields has no impact on the likelihood of a cross-site scripting attack because these fields are static content that cannot ordinarily be modified to create this type of attack. C. Web applications use cookies to save session state information on the client machine so that the user does not need to log on every time a page is visited.

    "Explanation": "A. A denial-of-service (DoS) attack is designed to limit the availability of a resource and is characterized by a high number of requests that require response from the resource (usually a website). The target spends so many resources responding to the attack requests that legitimate requests are not serviced* These attacks are most commonly launched from networks of compromised computers (botnets) and may involve attacks from multiple computers at once. B. Spoofing is a form of impersonation where one computer tries to take on the identity of another computer When an attack originates from the external network but uses an internal network address, the attacker is most likely trying to bypass firewalls and other network security controls by impersonating (or spoofing) the payroll server's internal network address. By impersonating the payroll server, the attacker may be able to access sensitive internal resources. C. Port scanning is a reconnaissance technique that is designed to gather information about a target before a more active attack.

    "CorrectAnswer": "B",
    "Domain": "PROTECTION OF INFORMATION ASSETS",
    "Explanation": "A. Biometrics are not used in digital signatures or public key encryption. B. The calculation of a hash, or digest, of the data that are transmitted, and its encryption require the private key of the client (sender) and is called a signature of the message, or digital signature. The receiver hashes the received message and compares the hash that they compute with the received hash, after the digital signature has been decrypted with the sender's public key. If the hash values are the same, the conclusion is that there is integrity in the data that have arrived, and the origin is authenticated. The concept of encrypting the hash with the private key of the originator provides nonrepudiation because it can only be decrypted with their public key, and the private key would not be known to the recipient. Simply put, in a key-pair situation, anything that can be decrypted by a sender's public key must have been encrypted with their private key, so they must have been the sender (i.e., nonrepudiation). C. It is not correct to encrypt the hash with the customer's public key because the recipient would need access to the customer's private key to decrypt the digital signature. D. A scan of the customer's signature is known as a digitized signature, not a digital signature, and is of little or no value in this scenario.",

On an Ethernet switch, there is a data table known as the address resolution protocol (ARP) cache that stores mappings between media access control and internet protocol (IP) addresses. During normal operations, Ethernet switches only allow directed traffic to flow between the ports involved in the conversation and no other ports can see that traffic. However, if the ARP cache is intentionally corrupted with an ARP poisoning attack, some Ethernet switches simply flood the directed traffic to all ports of the switch, which can allow an attacker to monitor traffic not normally visible to the port where the attacker was connected, and thereby eavesdrop on Voice-over Internet Protocol (VoIP) traffic.

    "Domain": "PROTECTION OF INFORMATION ASSETS",
    "Explanation": "A. Rule-based filtering will trigger false-positive alert each time a key word is met in the message. B. The advantage of this type of checksum-based filtering is that it lets ordinary users help identify spam, and not just administrators, thus, vastly increasing the pool of spam fighters. The disadvantage is that spammers can insert unique invisible gibberish⼀known as hashbusters—into the middle of each of their messages, thus making each message unique and having a different checksum. This leads to a race between the developers of the checksum software and the developers of the spam-generating software. C. A heuristic is a technique designed for solving a problem more quickly when classic methods are too slow, or for finding an approximate solution when classic methods fail to find any exact solution. This is achieved by trading optimality, completeness, accuracy or precision for speed. In a way, it can be considered a shortcut. D.

    "Explanation": "A. A leased line effectively extends the local area network of the headquarters to the remote site, and the mainframe Telnet connection travels over the private line, which is less of a security risk when using an insecure protocol such as Telnet. B. A firewall rule at the headquarters network to only allow Telnet connections from the internet protocol (IP) address assigned to the remote site makes the connection more secure than the current arrangement, but a dedicated leased line is the most secure option ofthose listed. C. Although two-factor authentication enhances the login security, it does not secure the transmission channel against eavesdropping, and, therefore, a leased line is a better option. D. Attacks on network services start with the assumption that network services use the standard Transmission Control Protocol/Intemet Protocol (TCP/IP) port number assigned for the service, which is port 23 for Telnet. By reconfiguring the host and client, a different port can be used.

    "Explanation": "A. An organization can place sensors outside of the firewall to detect attacks. These sensors are placed in highly sensitive areas and on extranets. B. An excessive number of false alarms from a behavior-based intrusion detection system (IDS) indicates that additional tuning is needed. False positives cannot be eliminated entirely, but ignoring this warning sign may negate the value of the system by causing those responsible for monitoring its warnings to become convinced that anything reported is false. C. Being weak against new types of attacks is expected from a signature-based IDS because it can only recognize attacks that have been previously identified. D. An IDS cannot detect attacks within encrypted traffic, but there may be good reason to detect the presence of encrypted traffic, such as when a next-generation firewall is configured to terminate encrypted connections at the perimeter. In such cases, detecting encrypted packets flowing past the firewall can indicate improper configuration or even a compromise of the firewall itself.",

    "OptionA": "Introduce a secondary authentication method such as card swipe.",
    "OptionB": "Apply role-based permissions within the application system.",
    "OptionC": "Have users input the ID and password for each database transaction.",
    "OptionD": "Set an expiration period for the database password embedded in the program.",
    "CorrectAnswer": "B",
    "Domain": "PROTECTION OF INFORMATION ASSETS",
    "Explanation": "A. The issue is user permissions, not authentication; therefore, adding stronger authentication does not improve the situation. B. This is a normal process to allow the application to communicate with the database. Therefore, the best control is to control access to the application and procedures to ensure that access to data is granted based on a user's role. C. Having a user input the ID and password for access provides better control because a database log identifies the initiator of the activity. However, this may not be efficient because each transaction would require a separate authentication process. D. It is good practice to set an expiration date for a password. However, this might not be practical for an ID automatically logged in from the program. Often, this type of password is set not to expire. 476 C/SA ® Official Questions, Answers & Explanations Manual 13th Edition",

However, if the guest network is not segregated from the production network, users can introduce malware and potentially gain inappropriate access to systems and information. B. The implication of this is that guests have access to the enterprise network. Allowing untrusted users to connect to the enterprise network can introduce malware and potentially allow these individuals inappropriate access to systems and information. C. There are certain platforms in which it is allowable for guests to interact with one another. Also, guests can be warned to use only secured systems, and a policy covering interaction among guests can be created. D. Although a multifactor authentication (MFA) technique is preferred, a single-factor authentication method should be adequate if properly implemented.",

    "CorrectAnswer": "B",
    "Domain": "PROTECTION OF INFORMATION ASSETS",
    "Explanation": "A. Overwriting a hard disk at the sector level completely erases data, directories, indices and master file tables. Reformatting is not necessary, because all contents are destroyed. Overwriting several times makes useless some forensic measures, which are able to reconstruct former contents of newly overwritten sectors by analyzing special magnetic features of the platter's surface. B. Deleting and formatting only marks the sectors that contained files as being free. Publicly available tools are sufficient for someone to reconstruct data from hard drives prepared this way. C. Although hole-punching does not delete file contents, the hard disk cannot be used anymore, especially when head parking zones and track zero information are impacted. Reconstructing data would be extremely expensive because all analysis must be performed under a clean room atmosphere and is only possible within a short time frame or until the surface is corroded.

A packet filter works at too low a level of the communication stack to provide granular control. C. The application gateway is similar to a circuit gateway, but it has specific proxies for each service. To handle web services, it has a hypertext transmission protocol (HTTP) proxy that acts as an intermediary between externals and internals but is specifically for HTTP. This means that it not only checks the packet internet protocol (IP) addresses (open systems interconnection (OSI) Layer 3) and the ports it is directed to (in this case port 80, or layer 4), but also checks every HTTP command (OSI Layers 5 and 7). Therefore, it works in a more detailed (granularity) way than the other choices. D. A circuit gateway is based on a proxy or program that acts as an intermediary between external and internal accesses. This means that, during an external access, instead of opening a single connection to the internal server, two connections are establishedone from the external server to the proxy (which conforms the circuit-gateway) and one from the proxy to the internal server.

    "CorrectAnswer": "B",
    "Domain": "PROTECTION OF INFORMATION ASSETS",
    "Explanation": "A. Vbice-over Internet Protocol (VoIP) telephone systems use the local area network (LAN) infrastructure of an enterprise for communication, which can save on wiring cost and simplify the installation and support of the telephone system. This use of shared infrastructure is a benefit of VoIP and therefore is not a concern. B. VoIP telephone systems use the LAN infrastructure of an enterprise for communication, typically using Ethernet connectivity to connect individual phones to the system. Most enterprises have a backup power supply for the main servers and systems, but typically do not have uninterrupted power supply units for the LAN switches. In the case of even a brief power outage, not having backup power on all network devices makes it impossible to send or receive phone calls, which is a concern, particularly in a call center. C. VblP devices do not normally encrypt the voice traffic on the local network, so this is not a concern. Typically, a VblP phone system connects to a telephone enterprise voice circuit, which is not normally encrypted. If the system uses the Internet for connectivity, then encryption is required. D. VblP telephone systems use the LAN infrastructure of an enterprise for communication, so the personnel who support and maintain that infrastructure are now responsible for the data and voice network by default.

    "Explanation": "A. Although this application may have strict requirements for availability, it is assumed that the service level agreement (SLA) would contain these same elements; therefore, this is not a concern. B. The right-to-audit clause is good to have, but there are limits on how a cloud service provider may interpret this requirement. The task of reviewing and assessing all the controls in place at a multinational cloud provider would likely be a costly and time-consuming exercise; therefore, such a requirement may be of limited value. C. Because the SLA normally specifies uptime requirements, the means used to achieve those goals (which include the specific disaster recovery plan capabilities of the provider) are typically not reviewed in-depth by the customer, nor are they typically specified in an SL A. D. Having data in multiple countries is the greatest concern because HR applicant data can contain personally identifiable information. There may be legal compliance issues if these data are stored in a country with different laws regarding data privacy.

Dynamic warehousing is not related to the security of object-oriented technology. C. Encapsulation is a property of objects, and it prevents accessing either properties or methods that have not been previously defined as public. This means that any implementation of the behavior of an object is not accessible.

    "CorrectAnswer": "A",
    "Domain": "PROTECTION OF INFORMATION ASSETS",
    "Explanation": "A. The peak at 96 percent can be the result of a one-off incident (e.g., a user downloading a large amount of data); therefore, analysis to establish whether this is a regular pattern and what causes this behavior should be carried out before expenditure on a larger line capacity is recommended. B. A peak traffic load of 96 percent is approaching a critical level, and the auditor should not assume that capacity is adequate at this time or for the foreseeable future. Further investigation is required. C. If the peak is established to be a regular occurrence without any other opportunities for mitigation (usage of bandwidth reservation protocol or other types of prioritizing network traffic), the line should be replaced because there is the risk of loss of service as the traffic approaches 100 percent. At this point, further research is required. D.

    "Domain": "PROTECTION OF INFORMATION ASSETS",
    "Explanation": "A. In this case, the first step is to identify the problem through review and analysis of network traffic. Using a protocol analyzer and reviewing the log files of the related switches or routers determine whether there is a configuration issue or hardware malfunction. B. Although increasing Internet bandwidth may be required, this may not be needed if the performance issue is due to a different problem or error condition. C. Although creating a baseline and implementing quality of service ensures that critical applications have the appropriate bandwidth, in this case, the performance issue may be related to misconfiguration or equipment malfunction. D. Although implementing virtual local area networks (VLANs) may be a good practice for ensuring adequate performance, in this case, the issue may be related to misconfigurations or equipment malfunction. 515 C/SA ® Official Questions, Answers & Explanations Manual 13th Edition",

    "Question": "In a small enterprise, an employee performs computer operations and, when the situation demands, the program modifications. Considering the lack of separation of duties in the IT environment, which of the following should the information systems (IS) auditor recommend to the IT management to mitigate the risk?",
    "OptionA": "Automated logging of changes to development libraries",
    "OptionB": "Additional staff to provide segregation/separation of duties (SoD)",
    "OptionC": "Procedures that verify that only approved program changes are implemented",
    "OptionD": "Access controls to prevent the operator from making program modifications",
    "CorrectAnswer": "C",
    "Domain": "PROTECTION OF INFORMATION ASSETS",
    "Explanation": "A. Logging of changes to production libraries is a good practice, but, because the administrator can alter the logs, this is not a sufficient control. B. Although adherence to segregation/separation of duties (SoD) and recruitment of additional staff are preferred, this practice is not always possible in small enterprises. C. An information systems (IS) auditor must consider recommending a better process. An IS auditor should recommend a formal change control process that manages and can detect changes to production source and object code, such as code comparisons, so the changes can be reviewed on a regular basis by a third party. This is a compensating control process. D. Requiring a third party to do the changes may not be practical in a small enterprise where another person with adequate expertise may not be available.",

    "Question": "Which is the MOST important step an auditor should consider while developing an audit plan based on a risk-based approach?",
    "OptionA": "Inventory the information systems in use in the enterprise and categorize them.",
    "OptionB": "Assess what risk affect systems and the severity of the impact on the business.",
    "OptionC": "Determine which systems impact critical enterprise functions and how close to real time they operate.",
    "OptionD": "Rank the systems based on risk assessment and decide the audit priority, resources, schedule and frequency.",
    "CorrectAnswer": "C",
    "Domain": "PROTECTION OF INFORMATION ASSETS",
    "Explanation": "A. An inventory alone will not provide sufficient information to assess risk related to critical functions. B. Audit risk is dependent on the auditor's assessed levels of inherent risk (the susceptibility of an audit area to error, which can be material, assuming there are no related internal controls), control risk (the risk a material weakness will not be prevented or detected by internal controls) and detection risk (the risk substantive tests will not detect an error which can be material). C. While planning the audit, the auditor decides what level of audit risk they are willing to accept The more effective and extensive the audit work is, the less risk of a weakness going undetected. Understanding the critical systems of an enterprise and how close to real time they operate will help ensure that the auditor has the information needed to make a risk decision. D. Not all systems require a place in the audit plan; some noncritical systems may rank higher than critical systems. Critical systems impacting the business should get priority in the audit plan when a risk-based approach is taken. 516 C!SA ® Official Questions, Answers & Explanations Manual 13th Edition",

    "Question": "What is the MAIN benefit of implementing a risk-based audit? A risk-based audit approach:",
    "OptionA": "links internal auditing to the enterprise's overall risk management framework.",
    "OptionB": "ensures that risk, risk responses and actions are being properly classified and reported.",
    "OptionC": "helps to identify residual risk not in line with the risk appetite, so that appropriate action is being taken to treat the risk.",
    "OptionD": "allows auditors to provide assurance to the board of directors that risk management processes are managing risk effectively in relation to the risk appetite.",
    "CorrectAnswer": "D",
    "Domain": "PROTECTION OF INFORMATION ASSETS",
    "Explanation": "A. Linking internal audit to the enterprise's overall risk management framework is one benefit derived from implementing risk-based audit, but it is not the main benefit. Risk-based audit refers to the enterprise's risk management framework. B. Classifying and reporting risk, responses and actions is not the main benefit; this is one of the outcomes of the risk-based audit. C. Identifying residual risk notin line with risk appetite is an outcome of the risk-based audit, but not the main benefit.",

    "Question": "An IT auditor reviewed the transactions log of an audit engagement partner and discovered some suspicious activity, which may be interpreted as potential fraud. However, the auditor was not able to determine the circumstances around the incidents or obtain further evidence. The auditor decided to disclose this information in case there are questions in the audit quality assurance review. In taking this action, the auditor has:",
    "OptionA": "violated auditing standards because the auditor should inform the appropriate authorities/management of the suspected fraud.",
    "OptionB": "violated laws because unlawful activities should have been reported to the appropriate regulatory agency.",
    "OptionC": "not violated auditing standards because the auditor has committed to disclose the facts, when required.",
    "OptionD": "not violated auditing standards because there is a lack of evidence as to whether a fraud has been committed or not.",
    "CorrectAnswer": "A",
    "Domain": "PROTECTION OF INFORMATION ASSETS",
    "Explanation": "A. In situations where auditors are not able to obtain sufficient or appropriate audit evidence necessary to achieve the audit objectives, they should disclose the situation to audit management and, if necessary, to those charged with audit governance, as per established procedures. Restrictions or limitations on the scope of the audit and achievement of the audit objectives should also be disclosed in the communication of the audit results. The auditor should also inform the appropriate authorities in the enterprise if the indicators of the fraud are sufficient to recommend an investigation. Thus, the auditor has a duty to act even though the available facts do not prove that an irregularity has occurred. Auditors should disclose all material facts and findings known to them that, if not disclosed, may distort the reporting of activities under review. B. Unlawful activities should not be reported to the outside entities until there is sufficient evidence; however, the suspicion of these activities should be disclosed to appropriate executives within the enterprise. C. The auditor has a duty to report the results of audit work in the audit communication.",
    "CorrectAnswer1": "A"
